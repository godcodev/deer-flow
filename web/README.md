This is the web UI project for [`DeerFlow`](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow).

[`DeerFlow`](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow) is a community-driven AI automation framework that builds upon the incredible work of the open source community. Our goal is to combine language models with specialized tools for tasks like web search, crawling, and Python code execution, while giving back to the community that made this possible.

## How to Install

DeerFlow Web UI uses `pnpm` as package manager.

```bash
pnpm install
```

## How to Run in Development Mode

```bash
pnpm dev
```

By default, the web UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
